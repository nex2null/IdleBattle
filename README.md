## CLI-RPG - Command Line Idle: RPG

#### Description
An incremental/idle RPG that you can play in a terminal

#### Build Instructions
> Download the latest version of NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/)  
> Run 'npm install' from the project root

#### Notes
If you're on windows, I recommend using the Windows Terminal (https://aka.ms/terminal) for running the application. Ctrl- and Ctrl+ will change font size. Choose a size that fits your display.
